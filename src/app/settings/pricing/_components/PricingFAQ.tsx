  },
  {
    title: "Do I have to pay anything to use Runp?",
    desc: " No. Runp is free to use and will remain free. It's a lightweight tool focused on the usefui.dev stack rather than a full-featured alternative to top-tier generative AI apps. If you need the broadest capabilities, those platforms may be a better fitâ€”but if you're working with usefui.dev and want something simple and fast, Runp is a great choice.",
  },
  {
    title: "Do my used credits carry over when I upgrade?",
    desc: "Yes. Credit usage is cumulative across plans. If you use 5 credits on the Free plan and then move to Pro (which includes 100 credits), you'll have 95 credits available after the upgrade.",
  },
  {
    title: "How can I get more usage if I run out of monthly credits?",
    desc: "Runp is free to use and will remain free. If you need additional monthly credits beyond what's included, please contact us to upgrade to the Enterprise plan.",
  },
  {
    title: "If I send a message, where does that usage come from?",
    desc: "Each message consumes your plan's credits. Runp uses tailored system prompts to generate reliable, persistent code for your specific needs and a smooth workflow. If you need to customize the core configuration or prompts, please contact us about upgrading to the Enterprise plan.",
